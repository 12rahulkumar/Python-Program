# OOP's

# in python everything is an object . to create object we required some model , blueprint which is nothing but a class

# we can write a class to represent properties and action of an object

# properties can be represented by variable
# action can be represented by methods

# it means class only contains variables and methods

# declare a class

class classname:
	"'documentation string'" # optional


print(classname.__doc__)
